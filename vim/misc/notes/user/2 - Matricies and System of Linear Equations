2 - Matricies and System of Linear Equations

# 2.1 - Matricies: Definition & Notation

Matrix: is a rectangular array of number.  Equal Matrixes: All numbers have to
be equal.  Row-Column Vector Matrix: 1xm or nx1 matrixes.  Transpose:
Interchange rows and columns.  Square Matrix: n x n matrix.  Diagonal: a11,
a22, a33, a44, a55 ... ann.  Lower Triangular: Numbers at the upside have to be
0.  Upper Triangular: Numbers at the downside have to be 0.  Diagonal Matrix:
If matrix is both upper and lower triangular.  Symmetric Matrix: If matrix is
equal to it’s transpose.  Skew-Symentric Matrix: If matrix is equal to negative
of it’s transpose.  Diagonal has to be zero.

# 2.2 - Matrix Algebra

Addition: Number columns and rows of 2 matrixies has to be equal Scalar
Multiplication: If all elements of matirx is multiplied by same number.
Substraction: A - B = A + (- 1) B
Zero Matrix: All elements have to 0.
