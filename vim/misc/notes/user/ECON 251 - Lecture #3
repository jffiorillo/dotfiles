# Consumer Theory

Consumer Behavior: We will develop a model of individual consumer
behavior that will provide the foundation for our analysis of
individual demand. By aggregating the individual demand of all
consumers we will then be able to derive market demand. dfdf

Rational Choice Model: 
  1. Consumers can rank in order of preference the options available to them 
  2. Among those options available to them, consumers select the one
     with the highest ranking.
  3. We are implicitly assuming that consumers understand all
     available options and can consistently rank them. 
  4. The rational model starts from the premise that consumers choices
     are consistent and coherent
